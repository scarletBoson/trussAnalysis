%j is joints and m is member number
j = input('Enter the number of joints: ');
m = input('Enter the number of members: '); 

%define the connection matrix a 1 is placed in the joint row and member 
%column where there is a connection
c = zeros(j,m);
quit = 0;

%replace zeros with ones whereever there are conections

while strcmpi(quit,"n")
r = input('enter the joints numbers that have connections: ');
c(r) = 1;
quit = input('Do you want to quit? Y/N: ');
end

%sum the columns of the connection matrix, the result should be 2 as each
%member should only be connected to two joints

cSum = sum(c);

%construct a connection matrix for the support forces along each axis with
%j rows and 3 columns
